My personal page that started as a portfolio/gallery and might go in any direction. 


## TODO list:
- [ ] Merge galeries and make space for research blogs
- [ ] Add the second language
- [ ] Change images to webp
- [ ] Add RSS subscription


## Run locally

Install `ruby` and then `jekyll`
```
gem install jekyll jekyll-feed webrick
```

Run 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
