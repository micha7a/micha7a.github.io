## June 2020
It's been a while... If you want to see what I've been up to, check out [Jakub's 
blog](https://sygnowski.ml)! 

## February 2020
I got a brush pen for birthday! And I don't know how to draw with it now :D 

## Inktober 2019
I made only a few [drawings](inktober.html) from 
[Inktober](https://inktober.com/rules) list, but I'm posting them
anyway because my bf suggested that, and I made those drawings using his brush 
pen, so I felt obliged. 

## April 2019: All galleries are up!
Now I have a few pictures in each category! This made me realise how few good 
and interesting drawings I have done. I have like, 10 different versions of the 
Owls, but there is not that much to put on the website in the end.

## March 2019: So, I made a website

This is supposed to be my personal website where I can post drawings.
There is a small chance for blog posts, comics or other stuff, 
but those will be rare.

Ideally I would also like to merge this page and my EPFL page (see link on the 
left), but that won't happen any time soon...
